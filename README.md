## My process
I created the desktop design first and then went on to create the mobile design. I had some difficulties at first but i had some help from friends and i was eventually able to do it. Created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript only.
### Steps:
  **1. Generate the HTML using JavaScript**
    **2. Style the generating HTML using CSS only** 

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
What i learned: When creating a responsive website for all devices create the mobile design first and the modify the changes to a dektop view[P.S not necessarily important to create mobile design first.I just think it's easier that way] 

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = @media (max-width: ) {}
```


### Continued development
Improve on my overall coding experience
My focus is on improving on creating responsiveness using **media query**.
